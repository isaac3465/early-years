<li><strong>Action for Children</strong>:
    <p>Action for Children is a UK-based charity with a mission to protect and support children and young people. Established in 1869, the charity works to improve children’s lives by advocating for their welfare and interests, intervening as early as possible to provide vital support. Action for Children supports families by answering their questions and connecting them to services and resources for children with additional needs.</p>
<p>The charity plays a crucial role in helping children and young people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness by providing accommodation, life skills, and support. In addition, it offers education, employment, mental health services, and emotional well-being support to young people. The organization works through partnerships with local authorities, schools, and other agencies to focus on early intervention before challenges become more severe.</p>
<p>Action for Children helps to prevent neglect and abuse by providing safe environments for children at risk, supporting families in crisis, and offering counseling for children facing mental health difficulties. It also matches children with supportive foster or adoptive families, ensuring they have a stable and loving home. The charity provides resources for children with special educational needs or disabilities, helping them to reach their full potential.</p>
<p>In times of crisis, Action for Children steps in to help by covering essentials such as food, clothing, and heating bills. Since 2020, the charity has donated £2 million in emergency grants to 15,000 families. Their mission also extends to campaigning against child poverty, urging MPs and ministers to act on the issue. The charity highlights that neglect affects 1 in 10 children in the UK, and every 15 minutes, a child enters care. In 2023, over 8,000 disabled children benefited from short breaks offered by the charity.</p>
<p>Action for Children provides practical and emotional support, ensuring children’s voices are heard while working toward long-term improvements in their lives. The organization’s support also extends to parents and carers, offering a variety of services. Through donations from the community, the charity helps prevent abuse, neglect, and homelessness by providing hot meals, crisis funds, and foster care placements.</p>
<p>Additionally, Action for Children operates a parent talk service to guide and support new parents in managing difficult situations, including self-harm and depression. The charity offers individual advice through parent coaches and provides mental health programs to help schools support their pupils. In total, Action for Children helped 687,755 families and children last year, reaching 372 communities and services.</p>
